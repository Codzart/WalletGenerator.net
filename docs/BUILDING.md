# Requirements
- Node.js v10 or later
  - All needed binaries will be installed automatically

# Install dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

# Just build the website

```bash
npm start
```
You can find website at `/public/`.   
This takes a long time to finish, be patient.

# Build the website and start development server

```bash
npm run browser
```
Open http://localhost:3000/ to test.

# Build the website and reload browsers

```bash
npm run reload
```
Browser tabs opening http://localhost:3000/ will be refreshed automatically after page build.
